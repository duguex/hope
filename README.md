构建大规模量子网络已成为当代量子信息科学的一个关键主题. 由于光纤中指数级的光子损耗, 地面纠缠分发的距离当前被限制在百公里量级[1]. 为了实现远距离的纠缠分发和量子态传输, 需要基于量子存储器和纠缠交换构建量子中继[2]. 到目前为止, 已有多种物理系统实现了量子存储功能, 具体包括气态原子系综[3-5]、单原子[6,7]、NV色心[8]和稀土掺杂晶体[9,10]. 由于稀土离子的4f
电子被外层5s
和5p
电子所屏蔽, 所以即使在固体中稀土离子仍然保持着近似自由离子的光谱特征和较长的相干时间. 因此稀土掺杂晶体作为固态系统已在光存储及量子存储方面展现出诸多优势, 如长存储时间[11-13]、大存储带宽[14,15]、多模式存储[16-21]、可集成性[14,22-24]以及直接支持通信波段[25-27]等. 
而稀土离子4f—4f
跃迁有着高相干时间的同时也伴随着与光场的弱相互作用. 弱吸收导致的介质低吸收深度限制了稀土掺杂晶体的存储效率上限. 而由于杂质稀土离子带来的晶格畸变导致了吸收线展宽的增加和光谱密度的降低, 因此通常不能直接增加稀土离子浓度来获得更高的吸收深度. 当前基于稀土掺杂晶体的量子存储实验都使用浓度在0.1%以下的低掺杂晶体[10,24,28-30], 导致了晶体光学吸收深度在较低的1—10 cm–1量级. 因此在当前众多的基于稀土掺杂晶体的存储演示实验中只有一个实现了超过50%的存储效率, 而且使用了长达2 cm的晶体并引入了侧面泵浦的复杂泵浦方案[10].

The research aims to demonstrate entanglement distillation on a quantum network of distant electron-nuclear two-qubit nodes.
Entanglement distillation is a process that improves the quality of entanglement between quantum systems by using local operations and classical communication.

The hyperfine interaction plays an important role in the research of quantum networks, as it affects the coherence and manipulation of qubits. Qubits are quantum bits that can store and process quantum information. The hyperfine interaction is the coupling between the magnetic moments of the electron and the nucleus in an atom or a molecule1. This coupling can cause the qubit to lose its quantum state or phase coherence due to the fluctuations of the nuclear spins2. Therefore, controlling or suppressing the hyperfine interaction is essential for achieving high-fidelity qubit operations and long coherence times.
The research articles that I found on the web search results show different ways of dealing with the hyperfine interaction in various quantum network platforms. For example, one article shows how to use hole spin qubits in silicon and germanium quantum dots, which have a tunable hyperfine interaction that can be reduced by an order of magnitude using device design and external electric fields1. Another article shows how to use electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dots, which have a very small hyperfine interaction due to the isotopic purity of silicon2. A third article shows how to use carbon nanotube quantum dots, which have an orbital hyperfine interaction that can be exploited for qubit manipulation and readout3.
The research article is about hole spin qubits in quantum dots, which are nanostructures that can store and process quantum information using the spin of missing electrons.
The research shows that the hyperfine interactions, which are the couplings between the hole spin and the nuclear spins in the material, can be controlled and reduced by device design and external electric fields1. These interactions cause noise and decoherence that limit the qubit performance.
The research also shows that the large spin-orbit interaction, which is the coupling between the hole spin and its orbital motion, can speed up qubit operations and renormalize the hyperfine noise, resulting in more coherent and high-fidelity qubit gates2.
The research provides guidelines to design high-performance qubits for scalable quantum computers using hole quantum dots in silicon and germanium materials3.

\cite{PhysRevLett.127.190501}

The paper investigates the hyperfine interactions (HFI) between silicon conduction electrons and 29Si nuclei, which are important for spintronic and quantum computing applications. The authors use an ab initio method to calculate the HFI parameters for a single extra electron in bulk Si and in a Si quantum dot (QD). They compare their results with existing experimental data and find good agreement.
The main findings of the paper are:
The HFI parameters for a conduction electron in bulk Si are isotropic and depend on the electron wave function at the nucleus site. The authors obtain a value of 0.8 MHz for the isotropic HFI constant A at the Fermi level, which is consistent with previous measurements.
The HFI parameters for a conduction electron confined in a Si QD are anisotropic and depend on the QD shape and size. The authors calculate the HFI constants A and B for a spherical QD with a radius of 2 nm and find that they are about 10 times larger than in bulk Si. They also compare their results with those for a GaAs QD and find that the HFI in Si is weaker due to the smaller nuclear spin and the larger band gap.
The HFI in Si QDs can be tuned by applying an external electric or magnetic field, which can affect the electron wave function and the nuclear spin polarization. The authors estimate that an electric field of 10 MV/m can change the HFI constant A by 10%, while a magnetic field of 1 T can change it by 1%.
\cite{PhysRevB.83.165301}
The paper is about the orbital hyperfine interaction (HF) in carbon nanotube quantum dots (QDs), which are nanostructures that can confine electrons and have potential applications in quantum information processing. The authors study how the nuclear spins of the carbon atoms in the nanotube interact with the valley degree of freedom of the electrons, which is related to their orbital motion around the nanotube circumference1. They find that this interaction, called orbital HF, has three main features: (i) it is approximately of Ising type, meaning that it depends on the relative orientation of the nuclear and valley spins; (ii) it is essentially local, meaning that it can be characterized by a constant atomic interaction strength that does not depend on the size or shape of the QD; and (iii) it has a comparable magnitude to the other HF mechanisms, such as Fermi contact and dipolar interactions2. The authors also show that orbital HF can cause a new decoherence mechanism for valley qubits and spin-valley qubits, which are quantum bits based on the valley or spin and valley degrees of freedom of the electrons3. They estimate the inhomogeneous dephasing time for a nanotube-based valley qubit and find that it can be significantly reduced by orbital HF4. The paper concludes that orbital HF is an important factor to consider for the design and control of QDs in carbon nanotubes and other multivalley materials.

The paper titled “A solid state light-matter interface at the single photon level” by Hugues de Riedmatten, Mikael Afzelius, Matthias Staudt, Christoph Simon, and Nicolas Gisin1 presents an experimental demonstration of the coherent and reversible mapping of a light field with less than one photon per pulse onto an ensemble of 10 millions atoms naturally trapped in a solid. The authors use a rare-earth-ion-doped crystal as the solid state atomic medium, which has advantages such as long coherence times, large inhomogeneous broadening, and high optical depth. The authors employ a technique called Atomic Frequency Combs (AFC) to create a periodic absorption structure on an optical transition and store the light field as collective atomic excitations. The stored light can be retrieved after a pre-programmed time by a collective interference process. The authors verify the coherence of the mapping process by performing an interference experiment with two stored weak pulses with a variable phase relation. They obtain visibilities of more than 95%, which indicates the high fidelity of the quantum state transfer between light and matter. The authors also show that their interface can store and retrieve light fields in multiple temporal modes, which is useful for quantum information processing. The authors claim that their results represent the first observation of collective enhancement at the single photon level in a solid and open the way to multimode solid state quantum memories as a promising alternative to atomic gases.
\cite{huguesderiedmatten_2008_a}

The paper reports an experimental demonstration of a quantum memory for light, which is a device that can store and retrieve the quantum information in a light field without destroying it1. Quantum memory is an essential component for quantum information applications such as quantum networks and quantum computing, as it allows the synchronization and manipulation of quantum processes2.
The authors use a technique called gradient-echo memory, which is based on the coherent interaction of light with rare-earth ions doped into crystals. The rare-earth ions have long coherence times for both their optical and spin transitions, which makes them suitable for storing and recalling light3. The gradient-echo memory works by reversing the detuning of the ions using an electric field gradient, which produces an echo of the absorbed light.
The authors show that their gradient-echo memory can achieve up to 69% efficiency and low noise levels, for coherent states with photon numbers ranging from 1 to 500. They also show that the memory preserves the quantum information of the input state more faithfully than a classical memory or a cloning device, which are the relevant benchmarks for the preservation of conjugate amplitude quadratures4. The authors discuss the possibility of improving the memory performance by using longer crystals, reducing background absorption, increasing bandwidth, and implementing long-lived spin storage. They suggest that hyperfine-resolved spectra and isotopically pure crystals could enable these improvements.
The paper is an important contribution to the field of quantum information science, as it demonstrates a high-efficiency and low-noise quantum memory for light using a solid-state medium5. The paper also provides insights into the physics of coherent optical memory techniques and their potential applications.

The paper reviews the chemistry and physics of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs), which are a type of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals that have emerged as promising optoelectronic materials in recent years.
LHP NCs have several advantages over conventional semiconductor NCs, such as their high optical absorption coefficients, low exciton binding energies, defect-tolerance, and facile solution synthesis. These properties enable them to achieve bright and narrow-band photoluminescence that can be tuned by halide composition or NC size over a wide range of wavelengths from the visible to the near-infrared region.

These features affect their optical and electronic properties, such as their emission spectra, quantum yields, carrier lifetimes, and mobilities. The paper discusses the mechanisms and implications of these features in detail.
LHP NCs have been used for various optoelectronic applications, such as television displays, light-emitting devices, and solar cells. The paper provides examples of how LHP NCs can improve the performance and efficiency of these devices by exploiting their tunable emission colors, high brightness, fast response times, and low operating voltages. The paper also highlights the challenges that need to be overcome for the widespread adoption of LHP NCs, such as their stability, toxicity, scalability, and integration with other materials.

History and background of LEDs: The article reviews the development of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from the discovery of electroluminescence in 1907 to the invention of high-brightness blue LEDs in 1994. It also explains some general aspects of color in lighting, such as the CIE diagram, color temperature, color rendering index, and Planckian locus.
Strategies for solid-state white lighting: The article compares three principal strategies for creating white light with a solid-state device: using multiple LED chips emitting at different wavelengths, using a UV LED chip and a combination of red, green, and blue (RGB) downconverting phosphors, and using a blue LED chip with a yellow downconverting phosphor1. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in terms of efficiency, color rendering, color stability, and thermal quenching.
Essentials of solid-state lighting phosphors: The article describes the intrinsic properties of the most widely used activator ions for white LED solid-state lighting, Ce3+ and Eu2+, and the effects of the host lattice on phosphor optical properties2. It explains how the energy levels, crystal fields, nephelauxetic effect, Stokes shift, thermal stability, and decay time of the activator ions are influenced by the host crystal composition and structure.
Some phosphor families: The article introduces some typical structural and compositional families of widely used and promising phosphor materials, such as orthosilicates, garnets, nitrides, oxynitrides, and silicates3. It summarizes their crystal structures, emission spectra, quantum efficiencies, temperature quenching behavior, and tunability.
Nitrides and oxynitrides of alkaline earths or rare earths with Si: These materials have high covalency and large crystal field splitting due to the presence of N3- ions, resulting in long-wavelength emission from Ce3+ or Eu2+ dopants. They also have high thermal and chemical stabilities due to the 3D network of corner-sharing Si(O,N)4 tetrahedra1. Some examples are M2Si5N8:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) and MSi2O2N2:Eu2+ (M = Ca, Sr, Ba), which have emission wavelengths from 570 to 680 nm and from 530 to 560 nm, respectively2.
Other oxides: Some oxide phosphors also show suitable luminescent properties for solid-state white lighting, such as Ce3±doped LaSr2AlO5, which has yellow emission with a maximum at 556 nm and can be tuned by isovalent substitutions of the cations3. Another example is Ce3±doped Ca3Sc2Si3O12, which has green emission with a maximum of 505 nm and can be codoped with Mn to enhance red emission4.
Oxyfluorides: Oxyfluoride phosphors generally have good thermal stability but poor chemical stability5. However, some oxyfluoride solid solutions, such as Sr3(AlO4F)1-x(SiO5)x:Ce3+ and Sr2Ba(AlO4F)1-x(SiO5)x:Ce3+, show excellent properties, including moisture stability and a highly tunable emission wavelength from 474 to 552 nm. These phosphors also have high quantum efficiency and low thermal quenching due to the soft phonon modes associated with F atoms in the host crystal6.
Electronic-Structure Theory of Organic Semiconductors: The article discusses the theoretical methods and models for describing the charge-transport properties of organic semiconductors, such as molecular crystals, polymers, and organic/inorganic hybrids. It also covers the electronic structure and interface energetics of metal/organic contacts, which are crucial for the performance of organic electronic devices.

Scintillator materials are materials that can scintillate, which means they can emit light when they are exposed to ionizing radiation, such as X-rays or gamma rays. Scintillators are useful for detecting and measuring radiation, as well as for medical imaging and security applications
Medical imaging: Scintillators are used to convert X-rays or gamma rays into visible light that can be detected by photodetectors and used to form images of the internal organs or tissues of patients. Scintillators are essential components of devices such as computed tomography (CT) scanners, gamma cameras, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanners.
Nuclear physics: Scintillators are used to measure the energy and position of particles produced in nuclear reactions or decays. Scintillators can also be used to identify the type of particles based on their scintillation characteristics. Scintillators are widely used in particle detectors, such as calorimeters, spectrometers, and trackers.
Security and safety: Scintillators are used to detect and identify radioactive materials or sources that may pose a threat to public health or security. Scintillators can also be used to monitor the radiation levels in the environment or in workplaces. Scintillators are employed in devices such as radiation detectors, portal monitors, cargo scanners, and personal dosimeters.
Industrial and geological applications: Scintillators are used to inspect the quality and integrity of materials or structures using X-ray or gamma-ray radiography or tomography. Scintillators can also be used to explore the natural resources or geological formations using neutron or gamma-ray logging or spectroscopy. Scintillators are utilized in applications such as non-destructive testing, oil and gas exploration, mining, and mineral analysis.
The difference between scintillator materials and photoluminescence materials is that scintillator materials emit light when they are exposed to ionizing radiation, such as X-rays or gamma rays, while photoluminescence materials emit light when they are exposed to non-ionizing radiation, such as ultraviolet or visible light12
Both scintillator and photoluminescence materials are examples of luminescent materials, which means they can produce light without heat. However, the mechanism and the characteristics of their luminescence are different. Scintillator materials absorb the energy of the ionizing radiation and re-emit it in the form of photons, which have a characteristic wavelength and color that depend on the type and energy of the radiation and the composition of the scintillator material. Photoluminescence materials absorb the energy of the non-ionizing radiation and re-emit it in the form of photons, which have a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed radiation12
Some examples of scintillator materials are sodium iodide (NaI) doped with thallium (Tl), lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) doped with cerium (Ce), and anthracene. Some examples of photoluminescence materials are zinc sulfide (ZnS) doped with copper (Cu), cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots, and fluorescein13
Scintillator materials are used for detecting and measuring radiation, as well as for medical imaging and security applications. Photoluminescence materials are used for optical devices, sensors, displays, and bioimaging12
Ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation are two types of radiation that differ in their energy and effects on matter1
Ionizing radiation has enough energy to remove electrons from atoms or molecules, creating ions. This process can damage living cells and DNA, causing mutations, cancers, or death. Ionizing radiation comes from radioactive elements, cosmic rays, or X-ray machines. Examples of ionizing radiation are alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, and X-rays123
Non-ionizing radiation has less energy than ionizing radiation and cannot create ions. It can only move or vibrate atoms or molecules, causing heating or chemical reactions. Non-ionizing radiation is usually harmless to living cells, unless the exposure is very high or prolonged. Non-ionizing radiation comes from natural or artificial sources of light, heat, or electricity. Examples of non-ionizing radiation are radio waves, microwaves, infrared rays, visible light, and ultraviolet rays12

Broad-band emission in metal halide perovskites: The authors review the mechanism, materials, and applications of broad-band emission in MHPs, which are versatile and tunable light-emitting materials with potential uses in LEDs, X-ray scintillators, fluorescence sensors and thermometers. Broad-band emission is characterized by a PL peak with a FWHM greater than 60 nm1.
Luminescent mechanisms: The authors discuss three main sources of broad-band emission in MHPs: dopants, self-trapped excitons (STEs), and defects2. Dopants are heteroatoms that introduce new electronic levels and radiative transitions, such as Mn2+, Cd2+, and rare earth ions. STEs are excitons that are localized by lattice distortions due to strong electron-phonon coupling, which are common in low-dimensional MHPs. Defects are vacancies or impurities that create additional local levels in the band gap and trap excitons or charge carriers.
Multi-color broad-band emitters: The authors highlight how different classes of MHPs frameworks can be designed to achieve various colors of broad-band emission, such as white, yellow, orange, red, and near-infrared. The factors that influence the color tuning include structural dimensionality, organic molecular engineering, hybridization of halogen ions, and B-site doping. The authors also provide examples of MHPs with different chemical compositions and crystal structures that exhibit broad-band emission.
Broad-band blue-emitting materials: The authors describe how different 0D and 2D MHPs can achieve high-efficiency blue-light emission with a PLQY of up to 83%. They also mention the effects of doping, molecular engineering, and cationic ion regulation on the emission color and intensity.
Broad-band green-emitting materials: The authors discuss how 0D MHPs with distorted octahedrons can produce green-light emission from STEs with large Stokes shifts and long lifetimes. They also highlight some examples of single-crystalline bulk assemblies of metal halide clusters with near-unity PLQYs and tunable emissions.
Broad-band yellow-emitting materials: The authors review how 2D and 0D MHPs with mixed-halogen or Sn2±based frameworks can generate yellow-light emission from STEs due to excited state structural reorganization. They also demonstrate how these MHPs can be used as phosphors for UV-pumped WLEDs with high Ra values.
Broad-band red-emitting materials: The authors report some novel lead-free MHPs with red-light emission from STEs or phosphorescence. They also show how these MHPs can exhibit switchable dual emission or light-induced structural deformation under different conditions.
Broad-band near-infrared-emitting materials: The authors present some examples of double perovskites or cyanine hybrid MHPs with NIR emission from dopants or exciton coupling. They also explain the potential applications of these MHPs in bioimaging, optical communications, and night vision.
Broad-band white-light-emitting materials: The authors summarize the strategies and challenges for achieving single-source white-light emission from MHPs. They also provide some cases of corrugated-2D, 0D, or post-perovskite-type MHPs with ultra-broad-band emission and high Ra and PLQY values.
ToF-FLI thermography: The authors demonstrate a novel technique to measure the temperature-dependent PL lifetime of MHPs using time-of-flight fluorescence lifetime imaging (ToF-FLI). This method can achieve high spatial resolution and sensitivity for thermographic applications. They show an example of using Cs4SnBr6 as a thermally sensitive luminophore to image a heated pattern.
Conclusions and outlooks: The authors summarize the main findings and challenges of MHPs as broad-band emitters. They emphasize the need for a better understanding of the luminescent mechanisms, the improvement of stability and toxicity, and the exploration of novel applications. They also suggest some future directions for designing and developing MHPs with tunable and high-performance emission properties.
Luminescent metal halides for optical applications: The authors review the synthesis, structure, and properties of various types of metal halides that exhibit luminescence from self-trapped excitons (STEs), dopants, or defects. They also discuss the potential applications of these materials in LEDs, lasers, scintillators, bioimaging, and optical communications.
Metal halide perovskites: The authors focus on the lead-based and lead-free perovskites with different dimensionalities and compositions that can produce broad-band or narrow-band emission from STEs or free excitons. They also highlight the challenges and opportunities for improving the stability, efficiency, and tunability of these materials.
Metal halide clusters: The authors describe the formation, structure, and luminescence of discrete or extended metal halide clusters with zero-dimensional (0D) or quasi-0D features. They also show how these clusters can be used as building blocks for designing novel luminescent materials with high quantum yields and large Stokes shifts.
Post-perovskite-type metal halides: The authors introduce a new class of metal halides with post-perovskite-type structures that can exhibit strong emission from STEs or dopants. They also demonstrate how these materials can be modulated by pressure, temperature, or light to achieve color tuning or switching.
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) provide a versatile platform for manipulating photoluminescence due to their multifarious crystal structures, chemical compositions and morphologies, therefore it is an urgent assignment to revisit their inherent properties from the perspective of both fundamental science and practical application \cite{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}1. Recently, MHPs have received extensive research attention, not only in potential photovoltaic applications \cite{11,12,13,14}, but also in photoelectric fields due to their attractive photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) properties including the wider absorption coefficient2 and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) \cite{15,16,17,18,19}. The solution processability greatly reduces their development cost in practical applications \cite{20,21,22,23,24}3. Remarkably, the broad-band emissions of MHPs encompass a striking diversity, which endows them with a fascinating prospect in optoelectronic devices \cite{26,27,28,29,30,31}4.
According to the connectivity character of BX6 octahedra (B2+:5 metal ions, X−: halide ions), perovskite-type structures can be classified6 into various dimensionalities, such as three-dimension (3D), two-dimension (2D), one-dimension (1D), and zero-dimension (0D) at the molecular level \cite{32,33}. Specifically, MHPs with the chemical formula of ABX3 are classified as 3D perovskites in which BX6 octahedra are7 corner-shared along all three 4-fold octahedral axes \cite{34}. 2D perovskites with layered structure, organized from octahedra connected along two octahedral axes, can be derived from 3D by slicing along specific crystallographic planes \cite{17,35}. If 2D perovskites are further sliced perpendicular to the inorganic sheets, octahedra remain connected only along one axis, which can be categorized as 1D perovskites8 \cite{32,36}. 0D perovskites are derived by further slicing of 1D, and are composed of isolated octahedra or clusters \cite{37,38,39}. In addition, a large group of double perovskites can not be neglected, and it is usually9 classified as a structural type of 3D perovskite. The double perovskites with a general formula A2BI10 BIIIX6 (A = Cs+, BI =Cu+, Ag+, Na+; MIII11 =Bi3+, Sb3+, In3+; X = Cl−, Br-, I−) maintain the 3D perovskite12 structure \cite{40,41,42,43}13. The versatility of their crystal structure endows them with tunable optical properties, and the low-dimension perovskites (e.g., 2D, 1D, and 0D) have recently emerged as promising candidates for light emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their good stability compared to 3D analogs \cite{24,28}. Especially after the discovery of white lightemitting 2D perovskites by Karunadasa et al. in 2014 \cite{46}, the broadband emitting MHPs are widely studied as promising luminescent materials \cite{47,48,49}14.
Generally, the broad-band emitters are characterized by a PL peak15 with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) greater than 60 nm. Different MHPs exhibit chraracteristic emissions with adjustable peaks16 positions and FWHM, making them suitable for the fabrication of multifunctional devices including LEDs, X-ray scintillators, fluorescence17 sensors and thermometers \cite{25-27-53-54-55-56-57-58-59}. To date, there is no review focusing on the research progress of broad-band emission in MHPs except for some descriptions in two recent reviews with a different emphasis \cite{25-53}19. Karunadasa and coworkers \cite{25} emphasized the different types of broad-band emissions, and analysed deeply the proposed mechanism of white-light emission,20 the effects of structure orientations and chemical compositions on emissions in variable 2D MHPs. In another review, Yan et al. and coworkers \cite{53} reported that a low electronic dimensionality is a prerequisite for the formation of selftrapped excitons (STEs) by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and thus it can be used as a theoretical basis to understand the21 origin of STEs-induced broad-band emissions22. However, the review did not discuss broad-band emissions induced by other models such as23 defects and dopants, and did not investigate the corresponding experimental progresses in MHPs. The multi-color broad-band emitters have their unique application prospects, and thus it is very imperative to provide a systematic account on various classes of MHPs frameworks. Not only that, the organic ligands, halogen contents, cationic compositions, and structural dimensionalities (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) all cause24 variable broad-band emissions among abundant MHPs. In addition, a challenge for solid-state light-emitting materials is that almost all the25 commercial broad-band emitters contain expensive rare-earth elements, such as europium (Eu2+) and cerium (Ce3+) \cite{60-61-62-63-64-65-66-67-68-69}. As the demand for rare earth elements continues to increase in almost all high-tech26 applications, their potential supply risks and raised prices make the search for alternative rare-earth-free phosphors very important \cite{70-71}26. The MHPs have recently emerged as a highly promising class of lightemitting materials with excellent color tunability, and they have the27 potential to address urgent challenges such as relating to energy saving and greenhouse gas emissions.
In view of these facts, the research progress of broad-band emitters28 in MHPs call for swift and consistent investigating the corresponding photo-physical phenomena. The structure of the review is as follows: in the following second section we reveal the luminescent mechanisms and ongoing progress, such as broad-band emissions of self-trapped29 excitons (STEs), defects (vacancy or impurity) or dopants (Mn2+, Cd2+, et al.); in the third section we have an emphasis on how the account of multi-color broad-band emitters can be designed in various classes of30 MHPs frameworks; in the fourth section we explore the current opportunities and challenges for LEDs and related emerging applications (Fig. 1). At last, we conclude the review with a summary and outlook,31 and put forward our perspectives on the ways to carry on the process evaluation.

The paper is a review article that provides an overview of zero-dimensional (0D) broadband emissive metal-halide single crystals, which are promising materials for lighting and display applications1.
The paper introduces the structural and optical properties of different dimensionalities of metal-halide materials, from 3D to 2D, 1D, and 0D. It explains how the decrease of dimensionality leads to stronger quantum and dielectric confinement, larger exciton binding energy, and enhanced radiative recombination2.
The paper discusses the mechanism of broadband emission in 0D metal halides, which is mainly attributed to the formation of self-trapped excitons (STEs) that result from the strong coupling between excited excitons and lattice phonons3. The paper also compares the intrinsic and extrinsic STEs, and their effects on the emission spectra and efficiency.
The paper summarizes the recent advances in 0D metal halides with different metal cations, such as Pb, Sn, Cu, Bi, Sb, In, etc. It highlights the achievements in tuning the emission color, enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and achieving white-light emission in single crystals.
The paper also presents some potential applications of 0D metal halides in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), water detection/sensor, X-ray scintillators, remote thermography, etc4. It discusses the challenges and opportunities for future development of these materials.
With extensive fundamental studies in the photophysical properties of 3D networked and 2D layered structures, little attention has been paid to the 0D structure.[1, 19, 20, 29] Reducing perovskite materials’ dimensionality gives rise to the modulation on their optical properties, including increasing bandgaps, enlarging exciton binding energy as well as enriching localized excitons.[25, 30] Thus understanding the photophysical properties such as exciton dynamics in 0D metal halides is crucial for both fundamental knowledge and the instructive design.
Of critical importance in the photophysical properties are the generation of excitons, charge carriers, and the diffusion and recombination of carriers in the photoexcited states. Exciton can be viewed as a bound electron–hole pair with strong Coulomb interaction,[31] which can be classified into two types, Wannier and Frenkel excitons according to the Bohr radii and Eb (Figure 4). Eb is regarded as the energy needed to separate the Coulombically bound carriers.[1] Wannier excitons feature small Eb ranged from 10 to 30 meV, lower than the thermal fluctuation energy (kBT) at room temperature (25.7 meV). Such excitons can ionize to free carriers at room temperature that can freely transfer within the crystal lattice, favoring photoelectronic applications such as solar cells and photodetectors.[7, 32] Frenkel excitons possess high Eb of 500–1000 meV,[33] highly desired for lighting applications due to the remarkable enhancement of radiative recombination, further enabling the high PLQYs.[34]
The decrease of structural dimensionality is found to significantly increases the Eb (Figure 5).[19] As presented in Figure 6, the photogenerated excitons in 3D networked structure can freely diffuse along three directions so the structure confinement is negligible and is not conducive for radiative recombination. For the extreme lowest dimensionality of 0D, excited excitons are highly confined in an isolated metal-halide unit to form localized excitons. In this case, excitons cannot migrate beyond the metal-halide unit, leading to the maximum radiative recombination probability.[19] Therefore, superior PL properties are often observed in 0D structure. In spite of the sharp increase of Eb in low-dimensional structures, similar to the characteristic of Frenkel-type excitons, they are still Wannier-type because the strong structural (or dimensional) quantum confinement of the wavefunction combining with the dielectric confinement (for organic-inorganic hybrid materials) can synergistically alter Eb.[35]
According to the different radiative mechanism in metal halides, exciton recombination can be originated from free excitons (FEs), bound excitons, and STEs. FEs refer the neutral Coulombically attracted electron–hole pairs that can freely migrate in the crystal lattice, which are popular in 3D materials with relatively lower Eb and are prone to dissociate into free carriers (electrons and holes) at room temperature.[36] FE-induced Radiative recombination usually feature in low luminescent efficiency with narrow emissions as well as small Stokes shift.[6, 11, 37] Upon strongly interaction with impurities or crystal lattice defects, FEs could be transformed into energetically stable bound excitons, the radiative recombination of which usually results in broadband emissions with a large Stokes shift.[38] As opposed to the impurity/defect-bound excitons, STEs can form even in the absence of lattice defects, by means of the creation of transient “light-induced lattice defects” that can be considered as “excited-state defects.”[5]
The presence of STEs is typically elusive because of their transient quasiparticle feature,[15] which are often observed in conventional II–VI and I–VII semiconductors, but not confessedly seen in 3D perovskites.[39] In low-dimensional metal halides, STEs are easily photogenerated as a result of the significant light-induced excited-state lattice deformation with respect to the ground state due to highly polar feature (soft lattice) as well as strong exciton-phonon coupling.[5] These excitons can form upon photoexcitation, while vanish after decaying to the ground state. STEs exhibit small exciton Bohr radii and large associated lattice deformations.[40] Through coupling to the polar lattice, the photogenerated excitons can lower the system's total energy as a result of the transient lattice deformation, which usually leads to a broad emission with a large Stokes shift.[15, 41] Depending on whether there are foreign ion doping or intrinsic defects existed in the host lattice, STEs can further be classified as intrinsic or extrinsic.[5] As shown in Figure 7a, the hard ball viewed as electron/hole/exciton can drop on a pliable rubber sheet viewed as a deformable crystal lattice and further sinks into a potential minimum it created, whereas the potential minimum can immediately recover after the excitation removing. Such process can be regarded as intrinsic STEs that does not require permanent material defects or emitting sites. In contrast, extrinsic STEs can be regarded as the ball dropping into an indentation in the sheet created by foreign dopants (Figure 7a). In both intrinsic and extrinsic STEs, the variant distribution of STE states with different self-trapping depths resulting from strong exciton-lattice interactions significantly contributes to the broadband emission that can even span the whole visible spectrum (Figure 1b). In contrast to the narrow emissions from other materials such as 3D perovskites, inorganic quantum dots, and organic emitters, emissions from bulk low-dimensional metal halides typically show large FWHMs (≥60 nm) as well as significant Stokes shifts (≥60 nm) (as shown in Figure 7b and Table 1).[42] Such broad emissions are originated from both distorted excited-states due to strong exciton-phonon/lattice coupling and inhomogeneous broadening owing to a distribution of trap states. For lighting applications, such broad emission, especially white emission achieved in a single material, is highly desired and has aroused tremendous attention, whose deep mechanism of this phenomenon is still being studied.
